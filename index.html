                        <p>My parents bought me my first set of drums when I was four years old. I remember the excitment coursing through my body that christmas morning. Since that day I do not think  there has been a period of time longer than six months in which I haven't drummed. Playing in bands was something I had always done growing up whether it be through the school or a group of friends, but following the passing of my mom in 2017, I spent 2018 and 2019 recording and touring with two bands in connecticut while also doing session work on the side. Creating and playing music is one of the greatest joys in my life and I hope to keep it as a life long hobby.</p>

                    <h1 class="title has-text-primary">Nature</h1>
                        <p>I have always been fascinated with the sciences involving what  makes our world tick. Primarily biology, geology, zoology, and envirometnal sciences. after seeing my first humpback whale in person I fell in love with learning about the world's oceans; ways to conserve what we have, all of the things we have yet to discover, and most importantly the creatures that inhabit it. My senior year of highschool at Amity I had the honor of being acknowledged with the excellence in marine biology award. After graduating highschool I volunteered at the Ansonia nature center. While I was there I had the privelage of taking care of the 30+ animals in our education center and maintaining the saltwater tanks, I also taught early education classes on the long island sound and ocean conservation. I hope one day to bridge the skills I gain through technology to help preserve our planet for generations to come. </p>

                    <h1 class="title has-text-primary">Technology</h1>
                        <p>My Dad has always been the most technologically literate person in my house and that is an odd thing for me to admit being a part of Gen Z, but it proved to be invalueable. My dad started his career as a graphic designer and climbed his way to the executive world of consulting. Through his journey he taught me so many interesting ways we can use the internet and technology to help create a brighter tomorrow. This is a world in which creativity and problem solving skills should not be taken for granted, and I hope to use mine and the other countless tools I will gain in this process to leave a positive impact on this world.</p>

This app allows the user to enter the title of a film they want a review of and using the IMDb API and the NYT reviews API we are able to return specific reviews for the user.</p>
